                    <h2>Design & Front-End Development projects</h2>
                    <p>These are my forté. Whether you need an extra person to see a project through or somebody to work on a project that you don’t have the expertise for, I'd love to help.</p>
                    <p>I prefer to work remotely, but I’m happy to travel to most places on a short-term basis to work with teams &amp; meet face-to-face.</p>

                    <h2>Consulting</h2>
                    <p>As a result of working with a variety of different teams, I can identify Design &amp; Usability problems then make improvement suggestions which would improve your offering and help acheive your goals. I’m also aware of where front-end development headaches occur and can work with you to ensure that these don’t happen.</p>
                    <p>After the consultation, I will supply you with a document covering issues &amp; recommendations, as well as methods to best implement these. I can consult remotely.</p>
