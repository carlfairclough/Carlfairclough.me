                        <h2>Doodles</h2>
                        <p>Over the past few years I've filled a book every two months or so with doodles, notes and snippets. Whilst they're not awe-inspiring they've always been a fun way to express myself, and every so often I like to look back on them - mostly because I get to see how embarassing I've been.</p>

                        <h2>Side Projects</h2>
                        <p>I don't have very much in the way of side projects, as a result of commitments with racing and freelancing, but have had the following projects:

                        <h3>Tumblr.carlfairclough.me</h3>
                        <p>Aha! A cliche Tumblr blog! I just collect things that I appreciate in here. Quotes, Design, Bikes, Cars, Architecture. It's a visual dumping ground for me and I enjoy it as an outlet, somewhere where I can show appreciation for different kinds of work. <a href="http://tumblr.carlfairclough.me">Take a look at it</a>.</p>

                        <h3>File-based CMS</h3>
                        <p>I spent a short while building a PHP based CMS which uses static files for content, thus mitigating the need for databases to be in sync (which has been a massive issue when developing updates, staging updates, and releasing updates). This project got put on hold after I found an existing CMS that operated in an almost-identical way (Kirby). <a href="http://tumblr.carlfairclough.me">Check out the unfinished project on GitHub</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Straighblock.cc</h3>
                        <p>Planned to set up a small cycling team with the founder of <a href="http://deafpigeon.co.uk">Deaf Pigeon</a>, to target races in Europe and be backed by sponsors. Plans included proposal documents for sponsors and pitch ideas. Kit design was also something that I valued as a part of this project - <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/carlfairclough/straightblockcc-mood-board/">take a look at the small pinterest board for it</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Sixo.co</h3>
                        <p>Myself and many of my friends based both in the North-West have a skill-set that when combined, equals that of a small agency. The domain has been purchased with a view to potentially setting up a design collective, as we all freelance in our spare time. The name was inspired by the Vitsoe 606 shelving system.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-9 med-col-12">
                        <h2>Photos</h2>
                        <p>Here is a collection of photos from the past few years. I did use a DSLR for a while until I realised that I used my iPhone way more. Take a look at my <a href="http://instagram.com/carlfairclough">Instagram account</a> to see more photos, and probably find out a lot more about me.</p>

                        <h2>Influences</h2>
                        <p>I like to think that I call on a fairly broad range of influences, however I've always been massively influenced by Futurism, Modernism and the Arts &amp; Crafts movement, as well as the other related movements from that era. The <a href="http://www.eightleaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/first-things-first1.jpeg">first things first manifesto</a> is something that I've always massively agreed with. It's a major reason behind why I want to work on something that makes people happy, why I've chosen to work mostly on digital products, and why I've turned down offers from Agencies.</p>

                        <h2>Work wish-list</h2>
                        <p>There are a few different things that have caught my eye and that I've wished to work on:</p>
                        <h3>Strava</h3>
                        <p>I'm obsessed with it, and rambled on enough about it when we met.</p>
                        <h3>SpaceX</h3>
                        <p>Who wouldn't want their work helping to get people up into Space?</p>
                        <h3>Rapha</h3>
                        <p>Rapha probably have one of the strongest brands around, and whilst being very expensive and very exclusive, they make cycling seem like an appealing sport/activity, rather than an odd hobby. Their clothing is top quality too, which makes their marketing feel more honest.</p>
                        <h3>Watsi.org</h3>
                        <p>Watso is a tool which allows people to fund healthcare for the disadvantaged. It's an incredibly valuable service despite the fact that I think that it should never have to exist.</p>
                        <h3>Vine</h3>
                        <p>Even though Instagram stole a lot of its thunder, Vine is fun. Working on fun things is fun. Who wouldn't want to work on that?</p>
