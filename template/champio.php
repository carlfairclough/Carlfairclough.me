                    <p>Champio aproached me looking for a designer to rethink their confusing MVP and turn it into a fun, engaging tool within a very short timeframe.</p>
                    <p>I worked within a tight schedule and completely overhauled their product, whilst also helping the team to make better design decisions in the future.</p>
                    <p>The majority of my time was spent wireframing and consulting with the team to make the user flows as seamless as possible.</p>

            <p>The final UI deliverables were based on wireframes developed by myself after lots of collaboration with the team, and by taking existing styles.</p>

            <p>The UI work started with Style Tiles, which found their way into elements which were at first designed along with the rest of the app. Iterative changes were made to individual modules and styles shared as much as possible in order to keep development costs down.</p>
