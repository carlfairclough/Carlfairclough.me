                            <p>Timetastic was a working product with an existing user-base, and was fresh out of beta. Their marketing website consisted  just of a sign up form, and this side of the product needed to improved drastically.</p>
                            <p>With the team behind Timetastic, I designed and built an entire marketing website, with the aim to both inform potential new users and assist existing users if they needed it. I also contributed to their billing introduction, and created a style library for the developers and future designers to use to move the product further forwards.</p>
                            <p>The project was a massive success, and Timetastic went on to have 2000 paid-for users inside its first month, which quickly increased to 6000.</p>

                    <p>The project went through various iterations, starting with a quick launch of a Wordpress-based website which was quickly scaled up &amp; improved.</p>
                    <p>Data was collected from the initial releases. Using this, ideal user-journeys were created and an updated marketing website was wireframed. This was released after extensive testing.</p>

                    <p>Once the marketing website was stable and only required iterative changes, my focus shifted to the iOS App.</p>
                    <p>It had numerous issues and I proposed dramatically overhauling the user-flows &amp; UI, using a mobile-specific HTML/CSS/JS app which would work on Android as well as iOS.</p>
                    <p>An integral part of this was prototyping interactions and thinking of new interaction models would be intuitive whilst working across platforms.</p>
