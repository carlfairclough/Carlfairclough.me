                            <p>I began work on Formisimo after they had received seed investment. I came in to accelerate the development of the product and massively improve it by bringing the inherited UI up-to-date and redesigning user-journeys.</p>
                            <p>With the team, I designed and built many different aspects of both the app and the marketing. I ran many AB/multivariate tests to ensure that I was not having a negative effect on users - the data proved that I wasn't, and I was integral to Formisimo's accelerating sign-up rate.</p>
                            <p>Since working on Formisimo, it has been featured widely in the media and has won many awards. Sign ups continue to increase and the product has a bright future ahead of it.</p>

                    <p>When starting on the project, the marketing material was identified as a real weakness and was having a negative effect on user impressions. I created concepts for future material, began to feed ideas from it into production by running many A/B tests.</p>

                    <p>Tthere was also no online billing system. I worked with the development team to build billing into the app using Stripe.</p>
                    <p>Multiple scenarios were tested and accounted for, and the amount of paying users rocketed after this functionality was implemented.</p>

                    <p>The sign-up &amp; onboarding process was identified as being massively flawed, requiring people to choose a plan to trial.</p>
                    <p>I planned an overhaul of the process, negating potential user issues and making it as smooth as possible. I prototyped the in-app onboarding process, delivering reusable code which could be used in production.</p>
                    <p>I initiated the project with extensive wireframing and planning, going through as many different iterations as possible, whilst also making sure that it could be released incrementally - ideally as a part of a weekly deploy process.</p>
